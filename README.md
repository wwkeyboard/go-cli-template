# go-cli-template

A template of a golang cli project. Please open an issue or PR or
whatever if you have any suggestions, I really want to learn!

# Usage

Copy this to a new folder, remove the hidden git folder and `git init` anew!

# Contents

## Arg Parsing

Includes a `Config` structure that holds the environment and command
line arguments used for configuring this application. If you add
anything it should go here. The parsing is triggered by `main()` but
doesn't happen within that function.
